## Problem:
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.
## Solution:
 To Predict if a person will suffer from heart diesease or not using various machine learning algorithms.
 
 Perfomed Data Analysis on data to find out various results.
 
 Used various statsitical test for feature selection.
 
 Perfomed Hyperpameter tunning of various model.
 
 Max accuracy achived was 80% using Random Forest.
## Libraries Used - 
  1. Pandas *(for data manipulation)*
  2. Matplotlib *(for data visualization)*
  3. Seaborn *(for data visualization)*
  4. Scikit-Learn *(for data modeling)*
